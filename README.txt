INTRODUCTION
=================================================================================
This game was initially intended to be a RPG dungeon crawler. The title of the
game "Morning Star" was indicative of the initial genre. We were inspired
by "Diablo", a popular RPG dungeon crawler. "Diablo" is another name for "devil"
and "Morning Star" is another name for "Lucifer", hence the attempted similarity.
Due to the lack of time, we decided to go with a more focused approached and 
scrapped the genre altogether. We wanted to twist the atmosphere of the original
genre and go for a darker, more foreboding tone and approach. Our next inspiration
for this genre was from a game called "Slender."

Art Assets
=================================================================================
All dungeon theme assets are from Decrepit Dungeon package from
the Unity asset store.  Photoshop CS6 was used by Genaro Orodio to create the Note asset by
editing the old parchment texture. Photoshop was also utilized to create the title
logo, and credits within the credits screen.  The text written on the note has an
appropriately themed font named "A Theme for Murder."

Audio Assets

All sounds were borrowed from opengameart.org and freefx.com.  Appropriate credits are given

Challenges and Issues
=================================================================================
Working in a 3-dimensional space is five times more difficult than working in
a 2-dimensional space.  It was a challenge to connect multiple 3D textures
together. It is really easy to make a mistake and result in texture clipping.  
Another issue we faced was that it was difficult to make enough time to get together. 
We had to rely on emails and bitbucket when working on this project.
=================================================================================


=================================================================================
Bugs
=================================================================================
There may be several clipping instances 
with the assets, particularly the wall and ceiling assets.
